# blogger
Simple blog created with Ruby on Rails as a "first project" (guide: The Odin Project)

If there are no users/authors currently in the database, the first login attempt will redirect to a new user creation screen.  Once one user account has been created, only logged in users can create additional user accounts.  Logged in users are also granted access to other additional features, such as editing accounts and articles, deleting articles and comments, resetting the number of article views to zero, and the Authors List (index) which allows for editing and deletion of users/authors.
